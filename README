==Introduction
GCal4Ruby is a full featured wrapper for the google calendar API.  GCal4Ruby implements
all of the functionality available through the Google Calnedar API, including permissions,
attendees, reminders and event recurrence.  

==Author and Contact Information
This branch was made by Matt Gornick (http://github.com/mgornick) to implement Google AuthSub into the original 
GCal4Ruby that was created and is maintained by {Mike Reich}[mailto:mike@seabourneconsulting.com] 
and is licenses under the GPL v2.  Feel free to use and update, but be sure to contribute your

==Description
GCal4Ruby has three major components: the service, calendar and event objects.  Each service
has many calendars, which in turn have many events.  Each service is the representation of a
google account, and thus must be successfully authenticated using valid Google Calendar
account credentials.  

==Examples
Below are some common usage examples.  For more examples, check the documentation.
===Service
1. Authenticate
    service = Service.new
    service.authenticate("user@gmail.com", "password")

2. Authenticate with Google AuthSub
		# your authentication controller (example is index action in the home controller):
			scope = 'http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/'
	    next_url = 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/home/authenticated'
	    secure = false  # set secure = true for signed AuthSub requests
	    session = true
	    @authsub_link = GData::Auth::AuthSub.get_url(next_url, scope, secure, session)

		# in your next_url controller as defined by your AuthSub link (in example would be the authenticated action)
			@token = params[:token]
  		client = GData::Client::Calendar.new
  		client.authsub_token = params[:token] # extract the single-use token from the URL query params
  		session[:token] = client.auth_handler.upgrade()
  		client.authsub_token = session[:token] if session[:token]
  		
  		service= GCal4Ruby::Service.new
  		service.authsub_authenticate(session[:token], "user@gmail.com")

3. Get Calendar List
    calendars = service.calendars

===Calendar
All usages assume a successfully authenticated Service.
1. Create a new Calendar
    cal = Calendar.new(service)

2. Find an existing Calendar
    cal = Calendar.find(service, "New Calendar", :first)

3. Find all calendars containing the search term
    cal = Calendar.find(service, "Soccer Team")

4. Find a calendar by ID
    cal = Calendar.find(service, id, :first)
===Event
All usages assume a successfully authenticated Service and valid Calendar.
1. Create a new Event
    event = Event.new(calendar)
    event.title = "Soccer Game"
    event.start = Time.parse("12-06-2009 at 12:30 PM")
    event.end = Time.parse("12-06-2009 at 1:30 PM")
    event.where = "Merry Playfields"
    event.save

2. Find an existing Event
    event = Event.find(cal, "Soccer Game", {:scope => :first})

3. Find all events containing the search term
    event = Event.find(cal, "Soccer Game")

4. Create a recurring event for every saturday
    event = Event.new(calendar)
    event.title = "Baseball Game"
    event.where = "Municipal Stadium"
    event.recurrence = Recurrence.new
    event.recurrence.start = Time.parse("13-06-2009 at 4:30 PM")
    event.recurrence.end = Time.parse("13-06-2009 at 6:30 PM")
    event.recurrence.frequency = {"weekly" => ["SA"]}
    event.save 

5. Create an event with a 15 minute email reminder
    event = Event.new(calendar)
    event.title = "Dinner with Kate"
    event.start = Time.parse("20-06-2009 at 5 pm")
    event.end = Time.parse("20-06-209 at 8 pm")
    event.where = "Luigi's"
    event.reminder = {:minutes => 15, :method => 'email'}
    event.save

6. Create an event with attendees
    event = Event.new(calendar)
    event.title = "Dinner with Kate"
    event.start = Time.parse("20-06-2009 at 5 pm")
    event.end = Time.parse("20-06-209 at 8 pm")
    event.attendees => {:name => "Kate", :email => "kate@gmail.com"}
    event.save
